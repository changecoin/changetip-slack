# ChangeTip Slack Bot

[ChangeTip](https://www.changetip.com) is a micropayment infrastructure for the web, enabling tips to be sent over social media. This code allows users to *tip* eachother with [slack](https://slack.com/), using the [slack api](https://api.slack.com/)

This repo is managed by the ChangeCoin (ChangeTip) team, but is open source for transparency and educational purposes. Pull requests welcomed!

## Tipping
Slack tipping uses slash commands. Type `/changetip`, then mention a @username and an amount.

Examples:

```
/changetip Give @victoria $5 for paying for my lunch
```

```
/changetip Give @jim a high five for the great work he just did
```

#### What's new?

We recently improved Slack tipping to utilize Slack slash commands! It makes tipping new users vastly less awkward, since recipients no longer have to type `changetip: accept`, and senders no longer have to resend the tip afterwards. Also, you can now tip people in private channels and direct messages!

## Slack setup

To enable tipping in slack for your team, 10 seconds of setup is required. Click this button:

<a href="https://slack.com/oauth/authorize?scope=commands&client_id=2661501386.15060437890"><img alt="Add to Slack" height="40" width="139" src="https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack.png" srcset="https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack.png 1x, https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack@2x.png 2x"></a>

Select your team and authorize the request. It will ask for permission to confirm the identities of team members and install a Slack slash command.

That's it! Start tipping! The bot will provide instructions with what to do. Don't be scared. :)

### Removing the old version (outgoing webhooks)

Eventually, we will deprecate the outgoing webhooks integration (we're talking about the one where you say `changetip:` instead of `/changetip`).

If you still have the old version installed, you can remove it by navigating to `https://yourteamname.slack.com/services`. From here, delete the integration called "ChangeTip Tip Bot", and disable/remove the "changetip:" Outgoing Webhook.
